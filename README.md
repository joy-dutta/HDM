# HDM
Honk Detection Module
This is a module designed by Dr. Joy Dutta and Mr. Debojit Chakraborty. The data repository present here is open data for other researchers to find data patterns in different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, bikes, etc. ) in different areas (urban, semi-urban, and rural). The designed HDM observes the pattern of honking data. From a smart city point of view, the way this module is done is meaningful because it can help city officials and drivers keep track of honking patterns in the city and for each user. Since honking is one of the leading causes of noise pollution, keeping an eye on it and taking the proper precautions can help make the world a cleaner place. This module can also help to identify a driver's driving pattern and an individual's nature as well. This HDM-based research paper is currently communicated with Nature Scientific Reports. Once it is published and available online, we will share the link to the paper to understand the importance of the data more effectively with a proper explanation. The potential of this device is limitless. 

For this study, we have constructed a diversified data collection path (Baruipur,WB, India to Jadavpur University, WE, India) where urban, semi-urban and rural areas are covered during this experiment to highlight and capture data to identify various issues and different tendencies present in our society.
